# JuCI
This is the Julia CI program written by me, Nils.

For now this is a prototype and more of a learning tool / playground for me to get familiar with Julia in an environment I sometimes know what I'm doing (Quantum Chemistry).

At this point, it is ugly, not a nice coding style, and can calculate HF energies for molecules.

We'll see what happens next.



TODO:

1. Harmonize coding style
2. Split code in different functions and files
3. Fix He bug
4. Properties (Dip. Moment)
5. CASCI Implementation
6. CASSCF Implementation
7. Integral Prescreening (Schwartz' Inequality)

X. XCFun for DFT?
