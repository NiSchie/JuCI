# JuCI
This is the Julia CI program.

For now this is a prototype and more of a learning tool / playground for me to get familiar with Julia in an environment I sometimes know what I'm doing (Quantum Chemistry).

At this point, it can't do much (RHF, more or less).

We'll see what happens next.


TODO:

1. CASSCF Implementation (And CASCI with that)
2. MP2
3. Useful damping and DIIS for RHF
4. Integral Prescreening (Schwartz' Inequality)
5. Geometry optimization (MP2)


X. XCFun for DFT?
